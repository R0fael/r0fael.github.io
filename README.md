This is my solo game. Where I had to copy Frogger, but I interpreted the game to be about driving a car and avoiding frogs. It was made in one month for Game like jam January 2025. It has placed second place in creativity. You can check out the game over [here](https://r0fael.itch.io/antifrogger).
### ClassBoom

This is a year long project, in which I implemented fully interacteable environment. That is a physics based sandbox game, with no particualr goal. It has a free demo version on steam. You can check it out [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3883870/ClassBoom/). I colaborated with an artist and a musician to do the game.
### Looping Dreams

This is a project made with an artist and a musician for GMTK game jam 2025(the biggest game jam) in three days out of four. The theme was loop. The game is about being in the same level, that resets each minute, and the goal is to escape from the looping dream, by solving puzzles. The game got into top 20% in the narrative category. You can play it [here](https://r0fael.itch.io/looping-dreams)
